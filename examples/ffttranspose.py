"""
This example shows how to implement an n-dimensional FFT over arbitrary axes
using a 1D FFT over the innermost dimension and transpositions.

At the moment of the writing, testing shows that the performance of this approach
is generally worse than that of the existing global FFT kernel
(the worst case being a 3D FFT with dimensions 1024x(16, 16, 16) on CUDA,
where the performance is almost halved).

Nevertheless, this computation is preserved as an example in case it is ever needed,
because it will greatly simplify the FFT computation.
